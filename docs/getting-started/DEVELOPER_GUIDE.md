# Developer Guide.

This guide goes through how to get started as a developer, if you want to contribute.  
The guide will go through how get the app running locally.

## Local Developer (With Dockercompose)

This is ideal for developers who don't care that much about contributing to the backend but want the local APIs.

### Pre-Requsites Needed.
The following software(s) are needed to get the app running in docker.
